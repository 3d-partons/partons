# What is PARTONS? 

---

PARTONS is a software framework dedicated to the phenomenology of 3D hadron structure, in particular Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Tranverse Momentum Dependent (TMDs) parton distribution functions.

The experimental program devoted to study GPDs and TMDs has been carrying out by experiments in several facilities, like CERN, DESY, Fermilab, Jefferson Lab and BNL. The 3D structure of hadrons will be also a key component of the physics case for the future US electron ion collider (EIC) and Chinese electron ion collider (EIcC). PARTONS is useful to theorists to develop new models, phenomenologists to interpret existing measurements and to experimentalists to design new experiments.

PARTONS provides a necessary bridge between GPD models and experimental data measured in various channels, like for example deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), timelike Compton scattering (TCS) and hard exclusive meson production (HEMP).

# What is 3DPartons?

3DPartons is a [virtual access infrastructure](http://www.strong-2020.eu/all-activities/virtual-access.html) supported by the European project [STRONG-2020](http://www.strong-2020.eu). 3DPartons gives access to open-source computing codes necessary for high precision phenomenology in the field of 3D hadron structure. Benefiting from the experience of decades of parton distribution function (PDF) studies, the GPD and TMD communities can find in 3DPartons a forum where they can mutualize knowledge and know-how about scientific and technical problems related to the complexity of the GPD and TMD computing chains. 

The virtual access infrastructure 3DPartons has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 824093. 

[NangaParbat](https://github.com/MapCollaboration/NangaParbat) is a fitting framework for the determination of TMDs from experimental data, like for example Drell-Yan measurements. The corresponding fitted TMDs can also be accessed through [TMDlib](https://tmdlib.hepforge.org).
[MontBlanc](https://github.com/MapCollaboration/MontBlanc) is a fitting framework for the determination of FFs from experimental data for single inclusive annihilation (SIA) and semi inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS).
[xFitter](https://www.xfitter.org/xFitter/) is a fitting framework for the determination of collinear distributions from a vast body of experimental channels. 
PARTONS,  NangaParbat, MontBlanc and xFitter share the common feature of being interfaced to [APFEL++](https://github.com/vbertone/apfelxx) which solves QCD evolution equations for various parton distributions, and to [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org) which provides access to modern PDF sets.

[EpIC](https://github.com/pawelsznajder/epic) is a generic Monte Carlo event generator for exclusive processes. It is fully compatible with PARTONS: it can be used to generate events for all exclusive processes and all models provided by PARTONS.

# What is PARTONS {#mainpage_intro}

<img src='../images/logo_partons.jpg' alt='PARTONS' style='float:right;max-width:15%;height:auto' />

PARTONS is a C++ software framework, dedicated to the phenomenology of Generalized Parton Distributions. PARTONS provides a necessary bridge between models of Generalized Parton Distributions and experimental data measured in various exclusive channels. Detailed description of the project can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06174

This framework should be useful not only for theorists to develop new models but also to interpret existing measurements and even design
new experiments. For the example of the use of PARTONS to fit the high precision DVCS data look [here](@ref talks_publ_dis2017).

# Get PARTONS {#mainpage_get}

This section helps you set up a functioning PARTONS environment, while the following sections are needed to understand how to use and develop with PARTONS. 

## With a virtual machine ######

You can use our provided virtual machine with an out-of-the-box PARTONS runtime and development environment. This is the easiest way to start your experience with PARTONS.

[Using PARTONS with our provided Virtual Machine](@ref vm).

## On your own machine ######

If you want to build PARTONS on your own machine then you should use one of following options:

[Using PARTONS on GNU/Linux](@ref linux).

[Using PARTONS on Mac OS X](@ref mac).


## Configuration  ######

If you are using [our virtual machine](@ref vm), all configuration files will be set up and you will be able to run PARTONS as it was out-of-the-box there. However, if you have installed PARTONS at your own machine, you may need to set up these files manually.

[Manual configuration](@ref config).

# How to use PARTONS {#mainpage_howtouse}

At this point you should have your own version of PARTONS available. Read the short [tutorial](@ref usage) how to use PARTONS. We provide two methods: using simple [input XML files](@ref usage_xml), or using PARTON's library and its headers to write a standalone [program](@ref usage_cpp).

When working with PARTONS one may want to use SQL database. Learn how to do this [here](@ref database).

If you want to extend PARTONS for your own purposes, you can create your own modules (for example new GPD model, new hard scattering kernel or new observable). Learn how to do it [here](@ref newmodule).
